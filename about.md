### WHY?

If you live together with somebody, or if you invite somebody into your house, it's a good idea to make sure that you share core values and agree on some basic rules of co-existence. Otherwise - things can get messy.
With the advent of a truly global civilization, we have all invited each other into our houses. We all live together now on one planet, so it sounds like a good idea to try and find some basic values that we all share - and explicitly agree to them. Mind you, this is not about having the same views - diversity is as crucial to successful co-habitation as sharing basic rules. What we are talking about is **not** total conformity, it's finding the common denominator - something that we can all agree to and then use as a basis for making our diversity benefit us all.

Religious Leaders, Philosophers, Psychologists and even [Politicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) have tried doing this before, but when somebody else agrees to something on your behalf, it usually doesn't matter that much. In short, [Social Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) sounds like a really good idea, the only problem being that no one remembers agreeing to it.

Now, thanks to the internet, we can fix this. We can give a chance to [almost half of the world's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage) to reflect and agree upon our Common Shared Values. These values do not represent any particular world-view or religion. Neither do they intend to contradict any world-view or religion. They are aimed to re-iterate and re-establish some basic ethical foundations upon which all the wonderfully diverse social, cultural, ethnic, religious and political communities can peacefully co-habitate the Earth.

If they are shared by most people already, then why do we need to agree on them "formally"?
There are three main reasons:

1. When you agree to something, when you sign something thoughtfully and voluntarily, you are much more likely to follow it, to stand by it.
2. Standing by something you believe in is so much easier when you know that you are not alone. 
3. When you don't know who you are dealing with, you automatically start from a very low level of trust. If you know that somebody shares your basic values, you can start your relationship with them from a higher level of basic trust. 

"You may say I'm a dreamer...", but I hope I'm not the only one. We shall see soon.

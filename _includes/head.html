  <meta property="og:description"   content="Planetary Social Contract. I want to live in peace. I want to be healthy and happy. I want to have access to adequate nutrition, shelter and healthcare. I donâ€™t want to be hurt, harmed, abused or forced to do anything. I want others to be honest and kind to me at all times. I want the skies to be blue, oceans to be clean, trees to be green. I want all animals, birds, fish and the rest of life on Earth to live and prosper as much as possible. I
  want to live in harmony with my family, my community and nature. I believe that all the above also applies equally to all humans regardless of their race, nationality, gender, age or religion. I promise to always do everything I can in order to make sure that all people have equal opportunity to lead a healthy, happy and fulfilling life, as described above. If I ever change my mind, or for any other reason start to behave in violation of the above (or advocate for such a
  behavior), I hereby grant the right and authority to the rest of my community to isolate me from them (forcefully, if there is no other way) for the sake of our mutual safety." />

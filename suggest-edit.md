### Want to make CSV better? Great!

There are two ways to do it:

1. Basic: You can simply send an email to commshava@gmail.com with "EDIT" in the subject. We will collect all ideas and create a voting mechanism for all of the CSV community to regularly review, accept and reject suggestions in a democratic way.

2. Better (but harder): We use [Github](http://github.com) to keep Common Shared Values on track. You can register there, fork [our repository](https://github.com/GeorgeStrakhov/commonsharedvalues), make your edits and submit a pull request. Pull requests that get a lot of support will be merged faster. You can add translations of the CSV document the same way.

Your contributions do matter!
Thank you!


George
